Meet humanID - An anonymous online identity, enabling platforms to offer the speed and comfort of social logins, while guaranteeing absolute privacy and protecting our communities by permanently blocking bots, spams, and trolls.
</p>

## Overview

humanID is an nonprofit, open-source initiative building a replacement to social media logins like “Login with Facebook”. Unlike existing logins, humanID allows users to sign onto third-party websites or apps with full anonymity. humanID creates a fully anonymous, privacy-first identity that enables communities to block bots and abusive users - creating accountable, civil communities.

Here's what makes humanID so great:

<ul>
	<li>No accessible user data is stored, so users remain fully anonymous</li>
	<li>Fast and easy to login</li>
	<li>It's free for end users</li>
	<li>Blocks automated accounts, cyber-bullies, trolls and freeloaders from websites and applications</li>
	<li>Makes bot networks at least 40x more costly to operate and easier to identify</li>
	<li>Gives platforms the ability to turn privacy and trust into a competitive advantage</li>
</ul>

## Requirements

* Xcode 11.4+
* Swift 5.0
* iOS 11.0+
* [Clean Swift](https://clean-swift.com) VIP architecture

***Please update to the latest SDK!***

## Built with

* [Swinject](https://github.com/Swinject/Swinject) - Dependency injection framework for Swift with iOS/macOS/Linux
* [RxSwift](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxSwift) - Reactive Programming in Swift
* [RxAlamofire](https://github.com/RxSwiftCommunity/RxAlamofire) - RxSwift wrapper around the elegant HTTP networking in Swift Alamofire
* [FlagPhoneNumber](https://github.com/chronotruck/FlagPhoneNumber) - A formatted phone number UITextField with country flag picker.

## Installation

HumanIDSDK is available through [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org).\
To install it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod 'HumanIDSDK'
```

## Get the credentials access

Get the clientId and clientSecret by dropping us an email [developers@human-id.org](mailto:developers@human-id.org).

## Configuration

Add these codes into your `AppDelegate.swift` and make sure all value is fulfilled.

```swift
import HumanIDSDK

@UIApplicationMain
class AppDelegate: UIResponder, UIApplicationDelegate {

  func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {
     HumanIDSDK.shared.configure(clientID: "YOUR_CLIENT_ID", clientSecret: "YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET")
  }
}
```

## How do I use iOS SDK

Add these codes into your ViewController file, we recommend you wrap this in a function that handles the login button.

```swift
import HumanIDSDK

class YourViewController: UIViewController {

  @IBAction func yourLoginAction(_ sender: Any) {
     HumanIDSDK.shared.requestOtp(view: self, name: "YOUR_APPLICATION_NAME", image: "YOUR_APPLICATION_LOGO")
  }
}

extension YourViewController: RequestOTPDelegate {

  func login(with token: String) {
     // TODO You can persist our token here.
  }
}
```

## You are set!

Now you can integrate your iOS app to humanID. See the full [sample](https://github.com/bluenumberfoundation/humanid-ios-sdk/tree/master/Example) here to learn more.

**Warning!**
To run the example project, clone the repo, and run `pod install` from the Example directory first.
